Title: A Patient Inflating Valve in Support of Modular Ventilator Design
----------------------------------------------------------
By: Avinash Baskaran and Robert L. Read


Introduction:
In the immediate response to the global ventilator shortage percipitated by the COVID-19 crisis, thousands of engineers and medical professionals organized 
independently to produce and distribute open-source ventilators [2]. While few new and truly open sourced designs have been deployed in hospitals and medical
environments, the substantial momentum of the engineering and medical communities around this problem presents the possibility of addressing such challenges 
in both the long and short term. Any device claiming to be able to provide safe, reliable and effective invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation to 
patients should provide a multitude of features, many of which have been set forth by relevant regulatory agencies. One such criteria, which is not always 
well-addressed is the need to support spontaneous breathing.

// I FEEL MORE CONSIDERATION TO THE DISTINCITON BETWEEN INVASIVE AND NON-INVASIVE VENTILATION IS NEEDED; 
// NEED TO THINK ON THIS MORE

Motivation:
While some of such ventilators have been designed to include special consideration for the support of patient spontaneous breathing, often, by the inclusion 
of controlled mechanical valves, many prominent commercial and open-source ventilaors fail to explicitly support spontaneous breathing in their designs [2][4]. 
The inclusion of a patient inflating valve, defined as a one-way valve that closes to enablelung inflation and opens to allow exhalation and spontaneous 
breathing [1], is one way a mechanical ventilator can achieved endeavour to support spontaneous breathing. 

Current work:
We have designed a low cost patient inflating valve using simple 3D printed parts, a $12 electric solenoid actuator and a microcontroller. This valve, or one 
like it could - in theory - be deployed in circumstances where spontaneous breathing is desired but not supported by the available ventilation technology. With 
two standard 22 millimeter female ports, the device is compatible with many ventilator designs. Its simple design and construction make it easy to adjust where
needed.

Conclusion and Future Work:

While we sought to optimize quick and simple fabrication as a primary design constraint, there are of course many factors to consider in designing 
such valves.
