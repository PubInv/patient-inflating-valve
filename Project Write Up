Public Invention project #52:

A DIY approach to the design and fabrication of Patient Inflating Valves
By: Avinash Baskaran and Robert L. Read


Previous extensive reviews of medical literature have led to a working definition of the "patient inflating valve" as a one-way valve that closes to enable
lung inflation and opens to allow exhalation and spontaneous breathing [1]. 

We have designed a low cost patient inflating valve using simple 3D printed parts, a $12 electric solenoid actuator and a microcontroller. There are, of 
course, many factors to consider in designing such valves, many of which have been codified by national regulatory agencies dealing with health and medical 
technologies, however we sought to optimize quick and simple fabrication.
