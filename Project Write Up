Title: A Patient Inflating Valve in Support of Modular Ventilator Design
----------------------------------------------------------
By: Avinash Baskaran and Robert L. Read


Introduction:
In an immediate response to the global ventilator shortage percipitated by the COVID-19 crisis, thousands of engineers and medical professionals organized 
independently to produce and globally distribute open-source ventilators [2]. While few truly open source designs have been deployed in hospitals and medical
environments, the mobilization and momentum of the "maker" community around this problem give credence ot the distributed, open-source model of addressing medical
challenges in both the long and short term. Modularity is one key element of this approach: groups endeavouring to produce open-source technologies, particularly
devices as complex and multifaceted as ventilators, can focus on producing adaptable parts of the device rather than end-user devices. This allows hospitals and 
end users to replace component systems of such devices when they fail, where the exact replacements may often be subject distribution delays and import/export 
restrictions during times of crisis, with equivalent alternatives to get whole device operational more quickly. To both encourage a modular appraoch to open source
ventilator designs as well as to provide such a quickly reproducible module, we have designed, fabricated and tested a ventilator "Patient Inflating Valve",
which is herein describe.

Motivation:
Any device claiming to be able to provide safe, reliable and effective invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation to patients should provide a multitude of 
features, many of which have been set forth by relevant regulatory agencies. One such criteria, which is not always well-addressed is the need to support 
spontaneous breathing.

// NEED TO ADD A DESCRIPTION OF THE ROLE OF PIVs IN INVASIVE AND NON-INVASIVE VENTILATORS

While some of such ventilators have been designed to include special consideration for the support of patient spontaneous breathing, often, by the inclusion 
of controlled mechanical valves, many prominent commercial and open-source ventilaors fail to explicitly support spontaneous breathing in their designs [2][4]. 
The inclusion of a patient inflating valve, defined as a one-way valve that closes to enablelung inflation and opens to allow exhalation and spontaneous 
breathing [1], is one way a mechanical ventilator can achieved endeavour to support spontaneous breathing. 

Current work:
We have designed a low cost patient inflating valve using simple 3D printed parts, a $12 electric solenoid actuator and a microcontroller. This valve, or one 
like it could - in theory - be deployed in circumstances where spontaneous breathing is desired but not supported by the available ventilation technology. With 
two standard 22 millimeter female ports, the device is compatible with many ventilator designs. Its simple design and construction make it easy to adjust where
needed.

Conclusion and Future Work:

While we sought to optimize quick and simple fabrication as a primary design constraint, there are of course many factors to consider in designing 
such valves.
