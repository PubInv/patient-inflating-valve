Title: Public Invention project #52:
A DIY approach to the design and fabrication of Patient Inflating Valves
----------------------------------------------------------
By: Avinash Baskaran and Robert L. Read


In the immediate response to the global ventilator shortage percipitated by the COVID-19 crisis, thousands of engineers, medical professionals and 
"public inventors" [3] organized independently in a massive worldwide effort to produce and distribute open-source ventilators [2]. While some of such 
ventilators have been designed to include special consideration for the support of patient spontaneous breathing, specifically, by the inclusion of controlled 
mechanical valves, many prominent commercial and open-source ventilaors have not explicitly included spontaneous breathing support in their design considerations 
[2][4]. The inclusion of a patient inflating valve, previosly defined as a one-way valve that closes to enablelung inflation and opens to allow exhalation and 
spontaneous breathing [1]. We have designed a low cost patient inflating valve using simple 3D printed parts, a $12 electric solenoid actuator and a microcontroller
which can be deployed in emergency circumstances to help support open-source ventilators. There are, of course, many factors to consider in designing such valves, 
many of which have been codified by national regulatory agencies dealing with health and medical technologies, however we sought to optimize quick and simple 
fabrication.
